## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not** open a public issue. Email **dev@symfinity.net** with:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- The location of the affected code (tag, branch, commit, or URL)
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact and plausible attack scenario

We aim to acknowledge within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 7 days.

## Security best practices

When using this bundle:

1. Keep Symfony, `symfinity/ux-blocks-core`, `symfinity/ui-kernel`, and other dependencies updated
2. Validate and sanitize all user input rendered through form components — this package provides markup and CSS, not server-side validation
3. When pairing with `symfinity/ux-blocks-kiosk`, treat showroom routes (`/kiosk/blocks/form`) as dev or internal tooling — do not expose without authentication in production
